    <h1>Style as HTML attribute</h1>
    <p>
      One way to style elements in a page is through the
      <strong>style="..."</strong> attribute which can be added to any html tag
      inside the body (body included)
    </p>
    <p>
      This is the easiest way to style an element, but it is not recommended.
      Only use for exception or very particular cases.
