    <h1>Style as HTML attribute</h1>
    <p>One way to style elements in a page is through the <strong>style="..."</strong> attribute which can be added to any html tag inside the body (body included)</p>
    <p>This is the easiest way to style an element, but it is not recommended. Only use for exception or very particular cases.</p>
